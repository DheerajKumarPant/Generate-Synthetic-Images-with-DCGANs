# Generate-Synthetic-Images-with-DCGANs-in-Keras

In this project we are able to sample from a complex, high-dimensional training distribution of the Fashion MNIST images. Sampling data from gaussian function is done, such as Gaussian noise. The model used power of neural networks to learn a transformation from the simple distribution(gaussian noise) directly to the training distribution that we care about. 
The GAN consists of two adversarial players: a discriminator and a generator. Weâ€™re going to train the two players jointly in a minimax game theoretic formulation.
